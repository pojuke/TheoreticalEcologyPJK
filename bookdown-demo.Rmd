# Course information{-}
<p style = "font-size: 24pt; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-top: 25px"> **Description** </p> The development of theory plays an important role in advancing ecology as a scientific field. This three-unit course is for students at the graduate or advanced undergraduate level. The course will cover classic theoretical topics in population and community ecology, staring from single-species dynamics and gradually build up to multispecies models. Emphasis will be on theoretical concepts and corresponding mathematical approaches.

This course is designed as a two-hour lecture (written on black board) followed by a one-hour complementary hands-on practice module. In the lecture, we will analyze dynamical models and discuss their theoretical implications. In the practice section, we will use a combination interactive applications and numerical simulations to gain more intuition of the dynamics and behavior of different models. 

<p style = "font-size: 24pt; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-top: 25px"> **Objective** </p>
By the end of the course, students are expected to be familiar with the basic building blocks of ecological models, and would be able to formulate and analyze simple models of their own. The hands-on practice component should allow students to link their ecological intuition with the underlying mathematical model, helping them to better understand the primary literature of theoretical ecology. 

<p style = "font-size: 24pt; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-top: 25px"> **Requirement** </p>
Students are only expected to have a basic understanding of **Calculus** (e.g., freshman introductory course) and **Ecology**. It's OK if you're not familiar with calculus as we will provide relevant material for you to review during the first week.

<p style = "font-size: 24pt; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-top: 25px"> **Format** </p>
Thursday 6,7,8 (1:20 pm ~ 4:20 pm) at Gongtong 207


<p style = "font-size: 24pt; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-top: 25px"> **Grading** </p>
The final grade consists of:

(1) Assignment problem sets (60%)
(2) Midterm exam (15%)
(3) Final exam (15%)
(4) Course participation (10%)

<p style = "font-size: 24pt; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-top: 25px"> **Course materials** </p>

# Week 2 - Exponential population growth {-} 

In part 1, we will solve the differential equation for exponential population growth and visualize how the population sizes change over time. 

<br>

**Part 1 - Numerical solution using the package `deSolve`**

Two main phases:

(1) Model specification: specify the structure of differential equation model

(2) Model application: set the time steps, initial population size and model parameters (e.g., intrinsic population growth rate $r$), and then solve the equation model

<style>

p span#aaa:before { 
  content: "(1) "; 
  display: inline-block;
  margin-left: -1.5em;
  margin-right: 0.3em;
}

p span#bbb:before {

  display: inline-block;
  margin-left: -1.5em;
  margin-right: 0.3em;
}

d-article table.lightable-paper {
  margin-bottom: 0px; 
}

</style>

Consider the model
\[
\frac{dN}{dt} = rN
\]
where $N$ is population size and $r$ is the intrinsic growth rate.
```{r}
###### part 1 ######
# install.packages("deSolve")
library(deSolve)

### (1) Model specification
exponential_model <- function(times, state, parms) {
  with(as.list(c(state, parms)), {
    dN_dt = r*N  # Exponential growth equation
    return(list(c(dN_dt)))  # Return the results
  })
}
```

Set the time steps, initial population size and model parameters.
```{r}
### (2) Model application
times <- seq(0, 10, by = 0.1)  # Time steps to integrate over
state <- c(N = 10)  # Initial population size
parms <- c(r = 1.5)  # Intrinsic growth rate
```

Solve the equation by `ode()` numerically.
```{r}
# Run the ode solver
pop_size <- ode(func = exponential_model, times = times, y = state, parms = parms)

# Take a look at the results
head(pop_size)
```

Visualization
```{r}
plot(N ~ time, data = pop_size)
```

Compare simulation result with analytic solution, which is
\[
N(t) = N_0\exp\{rt\}
\]
```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(N ~ time, data = pop_size) # Plot simulation data
curve(state[1]*exp(parms[1]*x), col = "red", add = T) # Adding analytic solution
plot(N ~ time, data = pop_size, log = "y") # Plot logged simulation data
curve(state[1]*exp(parms[1]*x), col = "red", add = T) # Adding analytic solution
```


<br>

**Part 2 - Comparing different ode solvers and different time intervals**
<br>
In default of `ode()`, the equations are solved by LSODA method. We can change the method by modifying the argument `method` in `ode()`. 

```{r}

###### part 2 ######
# Original setting
times <- seq(0, 10, by = 0.1)  # Time steps to integrate over
state <- c(N = 10)  # Initial population size
parms <- c(r = 1.5)  # Intrinsic growth rate
# Default: LSODA
pop_size <- ode(func = exponential_model, times = times, y = state, parms = parms)

# Euler's method
pop_size_1 <- ode(func = exponential_model, times = times, y = state, parms = parms, method = "euler")

# Compare different method
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(N ~ time, data = pop_size, main = "LSODA")
curve(state[1]*exp(parms[1]*x), times[1], times[length(times)], col = "red", add = T) # correct curve
plot(N ~ time, data = pop_size_1, main = "Euler")
curve(state[1]*exp(parms[1]*x), times[1], times[length(times)], col = "red", add = T) # correct curve

# Different time intervals
times_1 <- seq(0, 10, by = 1)  # time steps to integrate over
times_2 <- seq(0, 10, by = 0.1)  # time steps to integrate over
times_3 <- seq(0, 10, by = 0.01)  # time steps to integrate over

# Euler's method
pop_size_1 <- ode(func = exponential_model, times = times_1, y = state, parms = parms, method = "euler")
pop_size_2 <- ode(func = exponential_model, times = times_2, y = state, parms = parms, method = "euler")
pop_size_3 <- ode(func = exponential_model, times = times_3, y = state, parms = parms, method = "euler")

# Compare different time intervals
par(mfrow = c(1,3))
plot(N ~ time, data = pop_size_1, main = "Time intervals = 1")
curve(state[1]*exp(parms[1]*x), col = "red", add = T) # correct curve
plot(N ~ time, data = pop_size_2, main = "Time intervals = 0.1")
curve(state[1]*exp(parms[1]*x), col = "red", add = T) # correct curve
plot(N ~ time, data = pop_size_3, main = "Time intervals = 0.01")
curve(state[1]*exp(parms[1]*x), col = "red", add = T) # correct curve
```

<br>

**Part 3 - Solving exponential growth model with fluctuating growth rate**
<br>
Consider the model
\[
\frac{dN}{dt} = r(t)N \ \text{, } r(t) = \overline{r} + \sigma\sin(\omega t)
\]
where $\overline{r}$ and $\omega$ are constants.
The analytic solution of the ode model is 
\[
N(t) = N_0\exp\{\overline{r}t - \frac{\sigma}{\omega}[\cos(\omega t) - 1]\}
\]

```{r}
###### part 3 ######
### Model specification
exponential_model_fluc <- function(times, state, parms) {
  with(as.list(c(state, parms)), {
    dN_dt = (r_bar + sigma*sin(omega*times))*N  # exponential growth equation
    return(list(c(dN_dt)))  # return the results
  })
}
```


```{r}
### Parameters
times <- seq(0, 10, by = 0.1)  # time steps to integrate over
state <- c(N = 10)  # initial population size
parms <- c(r_bar = 1.5, sigma = 5, omega = 2*pi)  # intrinsic growth rate
```

Plot $r(t)$
```{r}
### Fluctuating growth rate
r = parms[1] + parms[2]*sin(parms[3]*times)
plot(r ~ times, type = "l")
```

```{r}
### Solving model
pop_size <- ode(func = exponential_model_fluc, times = times, y = state, parms = parms)

### Plotting
plot(N ~ times, data = pop_size)
curve(state[1]*exp(parms[1]*x - parms[2]/parms[3]*(cos(parms[3]*x) - 1)), add = T, col = "red") # correct curve
plot(N ~ times, data = pop_size, log = "y")
curve(state[1]*exp(parms[1]*x - parms[2]/parms[3]*(cos(parms[3]*x) - 1)), add = T, col = "red") # correct curve
```

Adjust $\overline{r}$
```{r}
### Parameters
times <- seq(0, 10, by = 0.1)  # time steps to integrate over
state <- c(N = 10)  # initial population size
parms <- c(r_bar = 0.1, sigma = 5, omega = 2*pi)  # intrinsic growth rate

### Fluctuating growth rate
r = parms[1] + parms[2]*sin(parms[3]*times)
plot(r ~ times, type = "l")

### Solving model
pop_size <- ode(func = exponential_model_fluc, times = times, y = state, parms = parms)

### Plotting
plot(N ~ times, data = pop_size)
curve(state[1]*exp(parms[1]*x - parms[2]/parms[3]*(cos(parms[3]*x) - 1)), add = T, col = "red") # correct curve
```

**Part 2 - Population growth with Allee effects**

Some populations experience negative growth rates when the population size is too low, a phenomenon known as "Allee effect". For example, some flowering plants require a minimal local density to attract pollinators (clustering effects). Below this density, pollinators will not be able to detect the presence of flowers and therefore the plants cannot complete their life cycle. Some flower species, e.g., *Itea*, requires a minimal population size of $A$ to attract its specialized bee pollinator and its population growth is directly related to pollinator visitation, its population dynamics can be described using the below differential equation:

$$
\frac{dN}{dt} = rN(1-\frac{N}{K})(\frac{N}{A}-1)
$$

where $0 < A < K$. The term $A$ represents "Allee threshold", below which the population growth rate is negative (because of no visiting pollinators) and thus the population will decline; $r$ is the intrinsic rate of increase and $K$ is the carrying capacity.

(1) You can calculate the equilibrium population sizes and use the graphical method to determine their stability. The equilibrium population sizes are $N^* = 0$ (stable), $N^* = A$ (unstable), and $N^* = K$ (stable).

```{r}
r = 1
A = 150
K = 500
curve(r*x*(1-x/K)*(x/A-1), from = 0, to = 550, xlim = c(0, 550),
      xlab = "N", ylab = "dN/dt", las = 1)
abline(h = 0, lty = 2)
points(y = rep(0, 3), x = c(0, A, K), pch = c(16, 1, 16))
text(x = c(0, A, K), y = rep(20, 3), labels = c("0", "A", "K"), font = 3, col = "blue")
arrows(x0 = c(100, 200, 550), y0 = -10, x1 = c(10, 450, 510), y1 = -10, length = 0.08, lwd = 2)
```

(2) Simulate the dynamics with an intrinsic rate of increase of $r$ = 1.2, the carrying capacity of $K$ = 1000, and the minimal threshold density of $A$ = 150. Observe the population trajectories to see how different initial population sizes can lead to different equilibrium population sizes (a phenomenon known as "alternative stable states").

```{r}
library(deSolve)
Allee <- function(t, state, pars) {
  with(as.list(c(state, pars)), {
    dN_dt = r*N*(1-N/K)*(N/A-1)
    return(list(c(dN_dt)))
    })
}
t <- seq(0, 7, by = 0.01)

state <- c(120,180, 300, 600, 900, 1200)
names(state) <- rep("N", time = length(state))
pars <- c(r = 1.2, A = 150, K = 1000)
par(mar = c(5, 4+2, 4,2) + 0.1)

for(i in 1:length(state)){
  #runthe ode solver
  pop_size <- ode(func = Allee, t = t, y = state[i], par = pars)
  plot(pop_size,ann = F, las =T, ylim = c(0, 1500), xlim = c(0.2,7))
  par(new = TRUE)
}
abline(h = 1000, col = "red", lty = 2)
abline(h = 150, col = "red", lty = 2)
axis(side = 2, at = 150, las = T)
title(main = paste0("Allee effect\n(r = ",pars["r"],
                  ", A = ",pars["A"],
                  ", K = ",pars["K"], ")"),

# Week 4 - Discrete exponential and logistic models{-} 

**Part 1 - Model the discrete logistic population growth using for loops**
Model:
\[
N_{t+1} = N_t(1+r(1-\frac{N_t}{K}))
\]

```{r}
### (1) Define the discrete logistic growth equation
log_fun <- function(r, N, K){N + r*N*(1-N/K)}
```

You may modify $r$ to see the change in stability of equilibrium $K$.
```{r}
### (2) Set the parameters
r <- 1.8
K <- 200
N0 <- 10
time <- 100
Parms <- c(r = r, K = K)

### (3) Use for loop to iterate over the time sequence
pop_size <- data.frame(times = 1:time)
pop_size$N[1] <- N0
for(i in 2:time){
  pop_size$N[i] <- log_fun(r = r, N = pop_size$N[i - 1], K = K)
}

### (4) Population trajectory
plot(N ~ times, data = pop_size, type = "l")
abline(h = K, col = "red")
points(N ~ times, data = pop_size)
```

**Part 2 - Generic cobweb**

```{r}
###### Part 2: Generic cobweb
### (1) define function
ReturnMap <- function(Func, x0, times, xmax, curve_n = 1000, parms){

  })
}
Parms <- c(r = r, K = K)

### (3) Use the ReturnMap function
ReturnMap(Func = Logistic,
          x0 = 10, 
          times = 150,
          xmax = 310,
          curve_n = 1000, 
          parms = Parms)

# Week 5 - Metapopulations and patch occupancy models {.unnumbered}

    Plants can condition nearby soil microbial communities, which will in turn influence the performance of subsequent colonizing plants. The soil beneath plant communities are therefore a mosaic with different cultivation histories. Po-Ju wants to understand how plant demographic rates (i.e., colonization and mortality rate) and microbial dynamics (i.e., the conditioning and decay rate of microbial communities) affect the percentage of different soil types in natural forests. As a starting point, Po-Ju builds a one-species patch occupancy model to track the dynamics of different types of plant-soil combination.

    In this model, he characterizes sites by their plant-soil microbe state, using the notation $P_{ij}$ to indicate sites that are now occupied by plant species $i$ but have soil microbes state $j$. Here, as a single species model, $i$ can be 0 or $A$, representing uncolonized sites or sites colonized by plant $A$, respectively. Similarly, $j$ can be 0 or $A$, indicating sites without recent plant conditioning history or sites conditioned by plant $A$, respectively. In summary:

1.  $P_{00}$ represents uncolonized and unconditioned sites
2.  $P_{A0}$ represents cites colonized by plant $A$ but the soil is yet to be conditioned
3.  $P_{AA}$ represents plant $A$ colonizing a site with plant-$A$-specific microbial community
4.  $P_{0A}$ represents sites that are currently unoccupied but have soil microbes that were associated with plant $A$

At the landscape scale, $P_{ij}$ represents the proportion of sites belonging to a particular plant-soil microbe state, and its dynamics, $\frac {dP_{ij}}{dt}$, summarizes the processes of plant colonization and death. The transitions between different plant-soil microbe states can be described by the following figure.

<img src="./Plant_soil_model.png" width="100%"/>

Here, $P_{00}$ can be colonized by plant $A$ when propagules arrive (per capita rate $r_{A}$), transitioning the state from $P_{00}$ to $P_{A0}$. Plants may die, with rate $m_{A}$, before conditioning the soil (i.e., transition from $P_{A0}$ back to $P_{00}$), or may successfully condition the soil with rate $c_{A}$ (i.e., transition from $P_{A0}$ to $P_{AA}$). After plants within the state $P_{AA}$ die, a site with microbial legacy is left behind, denoted as $P_{0A}$. These empty sites can be recolonized (i.e., transition from $P_{0A}$ back to $P_{AA}$) with rates affected by the microbial legacy effect, $\alpha$. Finally, the microbial community within the soil may decay to unconditioned state with rate $d_{A}$, transitioning the state from $P_{0A}$ to $P_{00}$.

    In this lab, we are going to model the dynamics of this plant-soil system. We will start by converting the flow diagram into a set of differential equations and then solve them numerically using the package `deSolve`.

```{r}
library(deSolve)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)


### Model specification
PSF = function(Time, State, Pars){
  with(as.list(c(State, Pars)),{
    dP00_dt = - rA * (PA0 + PAA) * P00 + mA * PA0 + dA * P0A 
    dPA0_dt = rA * (PA0 + PAA) * P00 - cA * PA0 - mA * PA0
    dPAA_dt = cA * PA0 + alpha * rA * (PA0 + PAA) * P0A - mA * PAA
    dP0A_dt = mA * PAA - alpha * rA * (PA0 + PAA) * P0A - dA * P0A
    return(list(c(dP00_dt, dPA0_dt, dPAA_dt, dP0A_dt)))
  })
}


#### Set simulation parameters with the 'quick simulation parameters'
pars = c(rA = 0.5,
         mA = 0.1,
         cA = 0.5,
         dA = 0.4,
         alpha = 0.3)


#### Set initial condition and time steps
times = seq(0, 100, by = 0.1)
ini = c(P00 = 0.75, PA0 = 0.1, PAA = 0.05, P0A = 0.1)


#### Run the simulation
pop_size = ode(func = PSF, y = ini, parms = pars, times = times)


#### Check if simulations reached stable point 
tail(pop_size)
rowSums(tail(pop_size[, -1]))

```

    After checking the outcomes of our numerical simulation, we can visualize the system dynamics through time, using any method you prefer. The following are some examples:

Visualization of the system dynamics through time using function `matplot`.

```{r}

#### Plot (matplot)
matplot(x = pop_size[, 1], y = pop_size[, 2:5], type = "l")

```

Visualization of the system dynamics through time using base R, with axis labels and given line colors.

```{r}

#### Plot (base R)
plot(x = range(times), y = c(0,1), type = "n", xlab = "Time", ylab = "Proportion")
lines(P00 ~ time, data = pop_size, col = "black")
lines(PA0 ~ time, data = pop_size, col = "blue")
lines(PAA ~ time, data = pop_size, col = "purple")
lines(P0A ~ time, data = pop_size, col = "red")
legend("topleft", 
       legend = c("P00", "PA0", "PAA", "P0A"), 
       col = c("black", "blue", "purple", "red"), lty = 1, bty = "n")
```

Data organization using package `tidyverse` and visualization of the system dynamics through time using package `ggplot2`.


```{r}

### ggplot course website version
pop_size %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  gather(key = "Patch", value = "Proportion", -time) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = time, y = Proportion, color = Patch)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1.5)
```


    Now we see that the system would eventually be stable, we can jump through the time series and directly take the final equilibrium point (assuming the selected simulation length works for different parameter values). Our next step is to modify the target parameter related to our research question and study their resulting outcome. For example, we want to see how the final fate of this system would change under different decay rates of the conditioned microbial effect (i.e., d_{A}, the transitioning from P_{0A} to uncolonized and unconditioned soil P_{00}). We can efficiently vary the target parameter using a for-loop to run the simulation under different decay rates.

Using for loop to run the simulation under different decay rates ($d_{A}$).

```{r}

### For-loop over different parameter values 
### Parameter range and saving space setup
dA_seq <- seq(from = 0.1, to = 0.8, by = 0.1)
Data <- as.data.frame(matrix(0, nrow = length(dA_seq), ncol = 6))
names(Data) <- c("dA", "time", "P00", "PA0", "PAA", "P0A")
Data[, 1] <- dA_seq

### Use for loop to change the parameter every time
for(i in 1:length(dA_seq)){
  
  # Set simulation parameters
  pars_new <- c(rA = 0.5, mA = 0.1, cA = 0.5, dA = dA_seq[i], alpha = 0.3)
  
  # Simulate
  pop_size_new <- ode(func = PSF, y = ini, parms = pars_new, times = times)
  
  # Save results
  Data[i, c(2:6)] <- pop_size_new[length(times), ]
}

```

Visualization of the stable state under different decay rates ($d_{A}$) using base R, with axis labels and given line colors. Does the pattern match your intuition?

```{r}
### Plot resulting equilibrium against different dA  
plot(x = range(dA_seq), y = c(0,1), type = "n", 
     xlab = "Decay rate of conditioned soil", 
     ylab = "Equilibrium proportion")
lines(P00 ~ dA, data = Data, col = "black")
lines(PA0 ~ dA, data = Data, col = "blue")
lines(PAA ~ dA, data = Data, col = "purple")
lines(P0A ~ dA, data = Data, col = "red")
legend("topleft", 
       legend = c("P00", "PA0", "PAA", "P0A"), 
       col = c("black", "blue", "purple", "red"), lty = 1, bty = "n")

```
