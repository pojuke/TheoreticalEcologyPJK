[["index.html", "Introduction to Theoretical Ecology Course information", " Introduction to Theoretical Ecology Instructor: Po-Ju Ke \\(~~~~~\\) Teaching Assistant: Hsiang-Chih Lo 2024 Fall at National Taiwan Univeristy Course information Description The development of theory plays an important role in advancing ecology as a scientific field. This three-unit course is for students at the graduate or advanced undergraduate level. The course will cover classic theoretical topics in population and community ecology, staring from single-species dynamics and gradually build up to multispecies models. Emphasis will be on theoretical concepts and corresponding mathematical approaches. This course is designed as a two-hour lecture (written on black board) followed by a one-hour complementary hands-on practice module. In the lecture, we will analyze dynamical models and discuss their theoretical implications. In the practice section, we will use a combination interactive applications and numerical simulations to gain more intuition of the dynamics and behavior of different models. Objective By the end of the course, students are expected to be familiar with the basic building blocks of ecological models, and would be able to formulate and analyze simple models of their own. The hands-on practice component should allow students to link their ecological intuition with the underlying mathematical model, helping them to better understand the primary literature of theoretical ecology. Requirement Students are only expected to have a basic understanding of Calculus (e.g., freshman introductory course) and Ecology. It’s OK if you’re not familiar with calculus as we will provide relevant material for you to review during the first week. Format Tuesday 6,7,8 (1:20 pm ~ 4:20 pm) at 共207 Grading The final grade consists of: Assignment problem sets (60%) Midterm exam (15%) Final exam (15%) Course participation (10%) Course materials We will use a combination of textbooks of theoretical ecology. Textbook chapters and additional reading materials (listed in the course outline) will be provided. (see Syllabus for more details).

Credit to Gen-Chang Hsu "],["week-4---metapopulations-and-patch-occupancy-models.html", "Week 4 - Metapopulations and patch occupancy models", " Week 4 - Metapopulations and patch occupancy models     Plants can condition nearby soil microbial communities, which will in turn influence the performance of subsequent colonizing plants. The soil beneath plant communities are therefore a mosaic with different cultivation histories. Po-Ju wants to understand how plant demographic rates (i.e., colonization and mortality rate) and microbial dynamics (i.e., the conditioning and decay rate of microbial communities) affect the percentage of different soil types in natural forests. As a starting point, Po-Ju builds a one-species patch occupancy model to track the dynamics of different types of plant-soil combination.     In this model, he characterizes sites by their plant-soil microbe state, using the notation \\(P_{ij}\\) to indicate sites that are now occupied by plant species \\(i\\) but have soil microbes state \\(j\\). Here, as a single species model, \\(i\\) can be 0 or \\(A\\), representing uncolonized sites or sites colonized by plant \\(A\\), respectively. Similarly, \\(j\\) can be 0 or \\(A\\), indicating sites without recent plant conditioning history or sites conditioned by plant \\(A\\), respectively. In summary: \\(P_{00}\\) represents uncolonized and unconditioned sites \\(P_{A0}\\) represents cites colonized by plant \\(A\\) but the soil is yet to be conditioned \\(P_{AA}\\) represents plant \\(A\\) colonizing a site with plant-\\(A\\)-specific microbial community \\(P_{0A}\\) represents sites that are currently unoccupied but have soil microbes that were associated with plant \\(A\\) At the landscape scale, \\(P_{ij}\\) represents the proportion of sites belonging to a particular plant-soil microbe state, and its dynamics, \\(\\frac {dP_{ij}}{dt}\\), summarizes the processes of plant colonization and death. The transitions between different plant-soil microbe states can be described by the following figure. Here, \\(P_{00}\\) can be colonized by plant \\(A\\) when propagules arrive (per capita rate \\(r_{A}\\)), transitioning the state from \\(P_{00}\\) to \\(P_{A0}\\). Plants may die, with rate \\(m_{A}\\), before conditioning the soil (i.e., transition from \\(P_{A0}\\) back to \\(P_{00}\\)), or may successfully condition the soil with rate \\(c_{A}\\) (i.e., transition from \\(P_{A0}\\) to \\(P_{AA}\\)). After plants within the state \\(P_{AA}\\) die, a site with microbial legacy is left behind, denoted as \\(P_{0A}\\). These empty sites can be recolonized (i.e., transition from \\(P_{0A}\\) back to \\(P_{AA}\\)) with rates affected by the microbial legacy effect, \\(\\alpha\\). Finally, the microbial community within the soil may decay to unconditioned state with rate \\(d_{A}\\), transitioning the state from \\(P_{0A}\\) to \\(P_{00}\\).     In this lab, we are going to model the dynamics of this plant-soil system. We will start by converting the flow diagram into a set of differential equations and then solve them numerically using the package deSolve. library(deSolve) library(ggplot2) library(tidyr) ### Model specification PSF &lt;- function(times, state, parms) { with(as.list(c(state, parms)), { dP00_dt = P0A*dA + PA0*mA - P00*(PA0 + PAA)*rA dPA0_dt = P00*(PA0 + PAA)*rA - PA0*mA - PA0*cA dPAA_dt = PA0*cA - PAA*mA + P0A*(PA0 + PAA)*rA*alpha dP0A_dt = PAA*mA - P0A*(PA0 + PAA)*rA*alpha - P0A*dA return(list(c(dP00_dt, dPA0_dt, dPAA_dt, dP0A_dt))) }) } ### Model parameters times &lt;- seq(0, 20, by = 0.1) state &lt;- c(P00 = 0.25, PA0 = 0.25, PAA = 0.25, P0A = 0.25) parms &lt;- c(rA = 0.5, mA = 0.1, cA = 0.5, dA = 0.4, alpha = 0.7) ### ODE solver pop_size &lt;- ode(func = PSF, times = times, y = state, parms = parms) # take a look at the results head(pop_size) ## time P00 PA0 PAA P0A ## [1,] 0.0 0.2500000 0.2500000 0.2500000 0.2500000 ## [2,] 0.1 0.2558649 0.2416153 0.2640144 0.2385055 ## [3,] 0.2 0.2609930 0.2339241 0.2773399 0.2277430 ## [4,] 0.3 0.2654349 0.2268709 0.2900255 0.2176687 ## [5,] 0.4 0.2692386 0.2204039 0.3021162 0.2082413 ## [6,] 0.5 0.2724484 0.2144756 0.3136533 0.1994227 tail(pop_size) ## time P00 PA0 PAA P0A ## [196,] 19.5 0.1283001 0.08252532 0.6866677 0.1025070 ## [197,] 19.6 0.1282914 0.08250852 0.6866865 0.1025136 ## [198,] 19.7 0.1282832 0.08249240 0.6867045 0.1025199 ## [199,] 19.8 0.1282754 0.08247693 0.6867217 0.1025260 ## [200,] 19.9 0.1282679 0.08246208 0.6867382 0.1025319 ## [201,] 20.0 0.1282608 0.08244784 0.6867539 0.1025375 ### Visualization I pop_size %&gt;% as.data.frame() %&gt;% gather(key = &quot;patch&quot;, value = &quot;proportion&quot;, -time) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = time, y = proportion, color = patch)) + geom_line(size = 1.5) ### Visualization II plot(range(times), c(0,1), type = &quot;n&quot;, xlab = &quot;time&quot;, ylab = &quot;proportion&quot;) lines(P00 ~ time, data = pop_size, col = &quot;tomato&quot;) lines(P0A ~ time, data = pop_size, col = &quot;navy&quot;) lines(PA0 ~ time, data = pop_size, col = &quot;gray&quot;) lines(PAA ~ time, data = pop_size, col = &quot;orange&quot;) legend(&quot;topleft&quot;, legend = c(&quot;P00&quot;, &quot;P0A&quot;, &quot;PA0&quot;, &quot;PAA&quot;), col = c(&quot;tomato&quot;, &quot;navy&quot;, &quot;gray&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;), lty = 1) "]]
