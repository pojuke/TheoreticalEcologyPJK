[["index.html", "Introduction to Theoretical Ecology Course information", " Introduction to Theoretical Ecology Instructor: Po-Ju Ke \\(~~~~~\\) Teaching Assistant: Guan-Yu Chen 2025 Fall at National Taiwan Univeristy Course information Description The development of theory plays an important role in advancing ecology as a scientific field. This three-unit course is for students at the graduate or advanced undergraduate level. The course will cover classic theoretical topics in population and community ecology, staring from single-species dynamics and gradually build up to multispecies models. Emphasis will be on theoretical concepts and corresponding mathematical approaches. This course is designed as a two-hour lecture (written on black board) followed by a one-hour complementary hands-on practice module. In the lecture, we will analyze dynamical models and discuss their theoretical implications. In the practice section, we will use a combination interactive applications and numerical simulations to gain more intuition of the dynamics and behavior of different models. Objective By the end of the course, students are expected to be familiar with the basic building blocks of ecological models, and would be able to formulate and analyze simple models of their own. The hands-on practice component should allow students to link their ecological intuition with the underlying mathematical model, helping them to better understand the primary literature of theoretical ecology. Requirement Students are only expected to have a basic understanding of Calculus (e.g., freshman introductory course) and Ecology. It’s OK if you’re not familiar with calculus as we will provide relevant material for you to review during the first week. Format Thursday 6,7,8 (1:20 pm ~ 4:20 pm) at Gongtong 207 Grading The final grade consists of: Assignment problem sets (60%) Midterm exam (15%) Final exam (15%) Course participation (10%) Course materials We will use a combination of textbooks of theoretical ecology. Textbook chapters and additional reading materials (listed in the course outline) will be provided. (see Syllabus for more details).

For example, some flowering plants require a minimal local density to attract pollinators (clustering effects). Below this density, pollinators will not be able to detect the presence of flowers and therefore the plants cannot complete their life cycle. Some flower species, e.g., Itea, requires a minimal population size of \\(A\\) to attract its specialized bee pollinator and its population growth is directly related to pollinator visitation, its population dynamics can be described using the below differential equation: \\[ \\frac{dN}{dt} = rN(1-\\frac{N}{K})(\\frac{N}{A}-1) \\] where \\(0 &lt; A &lt; K\\). The term \\(A\\) represents “Allee threshold”, below which the population growth rate is negative (because of no visiting pollinators) and thus the population will decline; \\(r\\) is the intrinsic rate of increase and \\(K\\) is the carrying capacity. You can calculate the equilibrium population sizes and use the graphical method to determine their stability. The equilibrium population sizes are \\(N^* = 0\\) (stable), \\(N^* = A\\) (unstable), and \\(N^* = K\\) (stable). r = 1 A = 150 K = 500 curve(r*x*(1-x/K)*(x/A-1), from = 0, to = 550, xlim = c(0, 550), xlab = &quot;N&quot;, ylab = &quot;dN/dt&quot;, las = 1) abline(h = 0, lty = 2) points(y = rep(0, 3), x = c(0, A, K), pch = c(16, 1, 16)) text(x = c(0, A, K), y = rep(20, 3), labels = c(&quot;0&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;K&quot;), font = 3, col = &quot;blue&quot;) arrows(x0 = c(100, 200, 550), y0 = -10, x1 = c(10, 450, 510), y1 = -10, length = 0.08, lwd = 2) Simulate the dynamics with an intrinsic rate of increase of \\(r\\) = 1.2, the carrying capacity of \\(K\\) = 1000, and the minimal threshold density of \\(A\\) = 150.

The soil beneath plant communities are therefore a mosaic with different cultivation histories. Po-Ju wants to understand how plant demographic rates (i.e., colonization and mortality rate) and microbial dynamics (i.e., the conditioning and decay rate of microbial communities) affect the percentage of different soil types in natural forests. As a starting point, Po-Ju builds a one-species patch occupancy model to track the dynamics of different types of plant-soil combination.     In this model, he characterizes sites by their plant-soil microbe state, using the notation \\(P_{ij}\\) to indicate sites that are now occupied by plant species \\(i\\) but have soil microbes state \\(j\\). Here, as a single species model, \\(i\\) can be 0 or \\(A\\), representing uncolonized sites or sites colonized by plant \\(A\\), respectively. Similarly, \\(j\\) can be 0 or \\(A\\), indicating sites without recent plant conditioning history or sites conditioned by plant \\(A\\), respectively. In summary: \\(P_{00}\\) represents uncolonized and unconditioned sites \\(P_{A0}\\) represents cites colonized by plant \\(A\\) but the soil is yet to be conditioned \\(P_{AA}\\) represents plant \\(A\\) colonizing a site with plant-\\(A\\)-specific microbial community \\(P_{0A}\\) represents sites that are currently unoccupied but have soil microbes that were associated with plant \\(A\\) At the landscape scale, \\(P_{ij}\\) represents the proportion of sites belonging to a particular plant-soil microbe state, and its dynamics, \\(\\frac {dP_{ij}}{dt}\\), summarizes the processes of plant colonization and death. The transitions between different plant-soil microbe states can be described by the following figure. Here, \\(P_{00}\\) can be colonized by plant \\(A\\) when propagules arrive (per capita rate \\(r_{A}\\)), transitioning the state from \\(P_{00}\\) to \\(P_{A0}\\). Plants may die, with rate \\(m_{A}\\), before conditioning the soil (i.e., transition from \\(P_{A0}\\) back to \\(P_{00}\\)), or may successfully condition the soil with rate \\(c_{A}\\) (i.e., transition from \\(P_{A0}\\) to \\(P_{AA}\\)). After plants within the state \\(P_{AA}\\) die, a site with microbial legacy is left behind, denoted as \\(P_{0A}\\). These empty sites can be recolonized (i.e., transition from \\(P_{0A}\\) back to \\(P_{AA}\\)) with rates affected by the microbial legacy effect, \\(\\alpha\\). Finally, the microbial community within the soil may decay to unconditioned state with rate \\(d_{A}\\), transitioning the state from \\(P_{0A}\\) to \\(P_{00}\\).     In this lab, we are going to model the dynamics of this plant-soil system. We will start by converting the flow diagram into a set of differential equations and then solve them numerically using the package deSolve. library(deSolve) library(ggplot2) library(tidyr) ### Model specification PSF = function(Time, State, Pars){ with(as.list(c(State, Pars)),{ dP00_dt = - rA * (PA0 + PAA) * P00 + mA * PA0 + dA * P0A dPA0_dt = rA * (PA0 + PAA) * P00 - cA * PA0 - mA * PA0 dPAA_dt = cA * PA0 + alpha * rA * (PA0 + PAA) * P0A - mA * PAA dP0A_dt = mA * PAA - alpha * rA * (PA0 + PAA) * P0A - dA * P0A return(list(c(dP00_dt, dPA0_dt, dPAA_dt, dP0A_dt))) }) } #### Set simulation parameters with the &#39;quick simulation parameters&#39; pars = c(rA = 0.5, mA = 0.1, cA = 0.5, dA = 0.4, alpha = 0.3) #### Set initial condition and time steps times = seq(0, 100, by = 0.1) ini = c(P00 = 0.75, PA0 = 0.1, PAA = 0.05, P0A = 0.1) #### Run the simulation pop_size = ode(func = PSF, y = ini, parms = pars, times = times) #### Check if simulations reached stable point tail(pop_size) ## time P00 PA0 PAA P0A ## [996,] 99.5 0.1634825 0.09738004 0.6174124 0.1217251 ## [997,] 99.6 0.1634825 0.09738004 0.6174124 0.1217251 ## [998,] 99.7 0.1634825 0.09738004 0.6174124 0.1217251 ## [999,] 99.8 0.1634825 0.09738004 0.6174124 0.1217251 ## [1000,] 99.9 0.1634825 0.09738004 0.6174124 0.1217251 ## [1001,] 100.0 0.1634825 0.09738004 0.6174124 0.1217251 rowSums(tail(pop_size[, -1])) ## [996,] [997,] [998,] [999,] [1000,] [1001,] ## 1 1 1 1 1 1     After checking the outcomes of our numerical simulation, we can visualize the system dynamics through time, using any method you prefer.

Our next step is to modify the target parameter related to our research question and study their resulting outcome. For example, we want to see how the final fate of this system would change under different decay rates of the conditioned microbial effect (i.e., d_{A}, the transitioning from P_{0A} to uncolonized and unconditioned soil P_{00}). We can efficiently vary the target parameter using a for-loop to run the simulation under different decay rates.

Part 3 - In-class exercise: Analyzing population matrix of common teasel Common teasel (Dipsacus sylvestris) is a herbaceous plant commonly found in abandoned fields and meadows in North America. It has a complex life cycle consisting of various stages. The seeds may lie dormant for one or two years. Seeds that germinate form small rosettes, which will gradually transit into medium and eventually large rosettes. These rosettes (all three sizes) may remain in the same stage for years before entering the next stage. After undergoing vernalization, large (and a few medium) rosettes will form stalks and flower in the upcoming summer, set seeds once, and die. Occasionally, the flowering plants will produce seeds that directly germinate into small/medium/large rosettes without entering dormancy. Here is a transition diagram for the teasel. Please convert this diagram into a stage-based transition matrix (Lefkovitch matrix) and derive the asymptotic growth rate \\(\\lambda\\) in R. ### Leslie matrix for Teasel Teasel &lt;- matrix(data = c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 322.38, 0.966, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.013, 0.010, 0.125, 0, 0, 3.448, 0.007, 0, 0.125, 0.238, 0, 30.17, 0.008, 0, 0, 0.245, 0.167, 0.862, 0, 0, 0, 0.023, 0.75, 0), nrow = 6, ncol = 6, byrow = T) ### Use eigen() function EIGEN &lt;- eigen(Teasel) ### Dominant eigenvalue abs(EIGEN$values[1]) ## [1] 2.32188 ### corresponding eigenvector round(as.numeric(EIGEN$vectors[, 1] / sum(EIGEN$vectors[, 1])), 3) ## [1] 0.637 0.265 0.012 0.069 0.012 0.005 Part 4 - COM(P)ADRE: A global database of population matrices COM(P)ADRE is an online repository containing matrix population models on hundreds of plants, animals, algae, fungi, bacteria, and viruses around the world, as well as their associated metadata.
