# Course information{-}
<p style = "font-size: 24pt; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-top: 25px"> **Description** </p> The development of theory plays an important role in advancing ecology as a scientific field. This three-unit course is for students at the graduate or advanced undergraduate level. The course will cover classic theoretical topics in population and community ecology, staring from single-species dynamics and gradually build up to multispecies models. Emphasis will be on theoretical concepts and corresponding mathematical approaches.

This course is designed as a two-hour lecture (written on black board) followed by a one-hour complementary hands-on practice module. In the lecture, we will analyze dynamical models and discuss their theoretical implications. In the practice section, we will use a combination interactive applications and numerical simulations to gain more intuition of the dynamics and behavior of different models. 

<p style = "font-size: 24pt; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-top: 25px"> **Objective** </p>
By the end of the course, students are expected to be familiar with the basic building blocks of ecological models, and would be able to formulate and analyze simple models of their own. The hands-on practice component should allow students to link their ecological intuition with the underlying mathematical model, helping them to better understand the primary literature of theoretical ecology. 

<p style = "font-size: 24pt; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-top: 25px"> **Requirement** </p>
Students are only expected to have a basic understanding of **Calculus** (e.g., freshman introductory course) and **Ecology**. It's OK if you're not familiar with calculus as we will provide relevant material for you to review during the first week.

<p style = "font-size: 24pt; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-top: 25px"> **Grading** </p>
The final grade consists of:

(1) Assignment problem sets (60%)
(2) Midterm exam (15%)
(3) Final exam (15%)
(4) Course participation (10%)

<p style = "font-size: 24pt; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-top: 25px"> **Course materials** </p>
We will use a combination of textbooks of theoretical ecology. Textbook chapters and additional reading materials (listed in the course outline) will be provided. (see [**Syllabus**](https://pojuke.github.io/TheoreticalEcologyPJK/syllabus.html) for more details).
